# 12KEMP
12KEMP is a 12 key 4 by 3 macropad, that features an Arduino Pro Micro with vial-qmk support, a rotary encoder, and a custom pcb with support for 3/5-pin switches.
All PCB files are in this repo, and you may create any form of case to mount the pcb onto. Additionally, a bill of materials (BOM) is included.

P.S. My keys look a little bit wonky since I used some 3-pin switches I had laying around. 5-pin switches are preferred since they are already aligned.
